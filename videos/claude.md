# CLAUDE.md

This is a remotion based video app that uses React to render videos. 

Full remotion docs can be found here: https://www.remotion.dev/docs/. Consult these docs often if you're uncertain.


# Project structure

The Root file is usually named "src/Root.tsx" and looks like this:

```tsx
import {Composition} from 'remotion';
import {MyComp} from './MyComp';

export const Root: React.FC = () => {
	return (
		<>
			<Composition
				id="MyComp"
				component={MyComp}
				durationInFrames={120}
				width={1920}
				height={1080}
				fps={30}
				defaultProps={{}}
			/>
		</>
	);
};
```

A `<Composition>` defines a video that can be rendered. It consists of a React "component", an "id", a "durationInFrames", a "width", a "height" and a frame rate "fps".
The default frame rate should be 30.
The default height should be 1080 and the default width should be 1920.
The default "id" should be "MyComp".
The "defaultProps" must be in the shape of the React props the "component" expects.

Inside a React "component", one can use the "useCurrentFrame()" hook to get the current frame number.
Frame numbers start at 0.

```tsx
export const MyComp: React.FC = () => {
	const frame = useCurrentFrame();
	return <div>Frame {frame}</div>;
};
```

# Component Rules

Inside a component, regular HTML and SVG tags can be returned.
There are special tags for video and audio.
Those special tags accept regular CSS styles.

If a video is included in the component it should use the "<OffthreadVideo>" tag.

```tsx
import {OffthreadVideo} from 'remotion';

export const MyComp: React.FC = () => {
	return (
		<div>
			<OffthreadVideo
				src="https://remotion.dev/bbb.mp4"
				style={{width: '100%'}}
			/>
		</div>
	);
};
```

OffthreadVideo has a "startFrom" prop that trims the left side of a video by a number of frames.
OffthreadVideo has a "endAt" prop that limits how long a video is shown.
OffthreadVideo has a "volume" prop that sets the volume of the video. It accepts values between 0 and 1.

If an non-animated image is included In the component it should use the "<Img>" tag.

```tsx
import {Img} from 'remotion';

export const MyComp: React.FC = () => {
	return <Img src="https://remotion.dev/logo.png" style={{width: '100%'}} />;
};
```

If an animated GIF is included, the "@remotion/gif" package should be installed and the "<Gif>" tag should be used.

```tsx
import {Gif} from '@remotion/gif';

export const MyComp: React.FC = () => {
	return (
		<Gif
			src="https://media.giphy.com/media/l0MYd5y8e1t0m/giphy.gif"
			style={{width: '100%'}}
		/>
	);
};
```

If audio is included, the "<Audio>" tag should be used.

```tsx
import {Audio} from 'remotion';

export const MyComp: React.FC = () => {
	return <Audio src="https://remotion.dev/audio.mp3" />;
};
```

Asset sources can be specified as either a Remote URL or an asset that is referenced from the "public/" folder of the project.
If an asset is referenced from the "public/" folder, it should be specified using the "staticFile" API from Remotion

```tsx
import {Audio, staticFile} from 'remotion';

export const MyComp: React.FC = () => {
	return <Audio src={staticFile('audio.mp3')} />;
};
```

Audio has a "startFrom" prop that trims the left side of a audio by a number of frames.
Audio has a "endAt" prop that limits how long a audio is shown.
Audio has a "volume" prop that sets the volume of the audio. It accepts values between 0 and 1.

If two elements should be rendered on top of each other, they should be layered using the "AbsoluteFill" component from "remotion".

```tsx
import {AbsoluteFill} from 'remotion';

export const MyComp: React.FC = () => {
	return (
		<AbsoluteFill>
			<AbsoluteFill style={{background: 'blue'}}>
				<div>This is in the back</div>
			</AbsoluteFill>
			<AbsoluteFill style={{background: 'blue'}}>
				<div>This is in front</div>
			</AbsoluteFill>
		</AbsoluteFill>
	);
};
```

Any Element can be wrapped in a "Sequence" component from "remotion" to place the element later in the video.

```tsx
import {Sequence} from 'remotion';

export const MyComp: React.FC = () => {
	return (
		<Sequence from={10} durationInFrames={20}>
			<div>This only appears after 10 frames</div>
		</Sequence>
	);
};
```

A Sequence has a "from" prop that specifies the frame number where the element should appear.
The "from" prop can be negative, in which case the Sequence will start immediately but cut off the first "from" frames.

A Sequence has a "durationInFrames" prop that specifies how long the element should appear.

If a child component of Sequence calls "useCurrentFrame()", the enumeration starts from the first frame the Sequence appears and starts at 0.

```tsx
import {Sequence} from 'remotion';

export const Child: React.FC = () => {
	const frame = useCurrentFrame();

	return <div>At frame 10, this should be 0: {frame}</div>;
};

export const MyComp: React.FC = () => {
	return (
		<Sequence from={10} durationInFrames={20}>
			<Child />
		</Sequence>
	);
};
```

For displaying multiple elements after another, the "Series" component from "remotion" can be used.

```tsx
import {Series} from 'remotion';

export const MyComp: React.FC = () => {
	return (
		<Series>
			<Series.Sequence durationInFrames={20}>
				<div>This only appears immediately</div>
			</Series.Sequence>
			<Series.Sequence durationInFrames={30}>
				<div>This only appears after 20 frames</div>
			</Series.Sequence>
			<Series.Sequence durationInFrames={30} offset={-8}>
				<div>This only appears after 42 frames</div>
			</Series.Sequence>
		</Series>
	);
};
```

The "Series.Sequence" component works like "Sequence", but has no "from" prop.
Instead, it has a "offset" prop shifts the start by a number of frames.

For displaying multiple elements after another another and having a transition inbetween, the "TransitionSeries" component from "@remotion/transitions" can be used.

```tsx
import {
	linearTiming,
	springTiming,
	TransitionSeries,
} from '@remotion/transitions';

import {fade} from '@remotion/transitions/fade';
import {wipe} from '@remotion/transitions/wipe';

export const MyComp: React.FC = () => {
	return (
		<TransitionSeries>
			<TransitionSeries.Sequence durationInFrames={60}>
				<Fill color="blue" />
			</TransitionSeries.Sequence>
			<TransitionSeries.Transition
				timing={springTiming({config: {damping: 200}})}
				presentation={fade()}
			/>
			<TransitionSeries.Sequence durationInFrames={60}>
				<Fill color="black" />
			</TransitionSeries.Sequence>
			<TransitionSeries.Transition
				timing={linearTiming({durationInFrames: 30})}
				presentation={wipe()}
			/>
			<TransitionSeries.Sequence durationInFrames={60}>
				<Fill color="white" />
			</TransitionSeries.Sequence>
		</TransitionSeries>
	);
};
```

"TransitionSeries.Sequence" works like "Series.Sequence" but has no "offset" prop.
The order of tags is important, "TransitionSeries.Transition" must be inbetween "TransitionSeries.Sequence" tags.

Remotion needs all of the React code to be deterministic. Therefore, it is forbidden to use the Math.random() API.
If randomness is requested, the "random()" function from "remotion" should be used and a static seed should be passed to it.
The random function returns a number between 0 and 1.

```tsx twoslash
import {random} from 'remotion';

export const MyComp: React.FC = () => {
	return <div>Random number: {random('my-seed')}</div>;
};
```

Remotion includes an interpolate() helper that can animate values over time.

```tsx
import {interpolate} from 'remotion';

export const MyComp: React.FC = () => {
	const frame = useCurrentFrame();
	const value = interpolate(frame, [0, 100], [0, 1], {
		extrapolateLeft: 'clamp',
		extrapolateRight: 'clamp',
	});
	return (
		<div>
			Frame {frame}: {value}
		</div>
	);
};
```

The "interpolate()" function accepts a number and two arrays of numbers.
The first argument is the value to animate.
The first array is the input range, the second array is the output range.
The fourth argument is optional but code should add "extrapolateLeft: 'clamp'" and "extrapolateRight: 'clamp'" by default.
The function returns a number between the first and second array.

If the "fps", "durationInFrames", "height" or "width" of the composition are required, the "useVideoConfig()" hook from "remotion" should be used.

```tsx
import {useVideoConfig} from 'remotion';

export const MyComp: React.FC = () => {
	const {fps, durationInFrames, height, width} = useVideoConfig();
	return (
		<div>
			fps: {fps}
			durationInFrames: {durationInFrames}
			height: {height}
			width: {width}
		</div>
	);
};
```

Remotion includes a "spring()" helper that can animate values over time.
Below is the suggested default usage.

```tsx
import {spring} from 'remotion';

export const MyComp: React.FC = () => {
	const frame = useCurrentFrame();
	const {fps} = useVideoConfig();

	const value = spring({
		fps,
		frame,
		config: {
			damping: 200,
		},
	});
	return (
		<div>
			Frame {frame}: {value}
		</div>
	);
};
```

## Making UI components

When making UI components remember that UI components in Remotion are fundamentally different from normal interactive React components:

### Remotion Components vs Interactive React Components

**Remotion Components:**
- Are rendered frame-by-frame to create videos
- Cannot have user interactions (no onClick, onHover, etc.)
- Cannot use hooks like useState for interactivity
- Must be deterministic - same input always produces same output
- Animations are driven by the current frame number
- No event handlers or user input handling
- Focus on visual presentation and animation

**Normal React Components:**
- Handle user interactions and events
- Use state management (useState, useReducer, etc.)
- Can fetch data asynchronously
- Respond to user input in real-time
- Have lifecycle methods and effects that run over time

### Key Differences in Implementation

1. **State Management**
   - Remotion: Use `useCurrentFrame()` to drive animations
   - Normal React: Use `useState()` for interactive state

2. **Animations**
   - Remotion: Use `interpolate()` or `spring()` based on frame number
   - Normal React: Use CSS transitions, animation libraries, or requestAnimationFrame

3. **User Input**
   - Remotion: No user input - all props must be passed at composition time
   - Normal React: Handle clicks, form inputs, gestures, etc.

4. **Effects**
   - Remotion: Avoid useEffect - calculations should be pure based on frame
   - Normal React: Use useEffect for side effects and subscriptions

### Example Comparison

**Button in Normal React:**
```tsx
const Button = () => {
  const [clicked, setClicked] = useState(false);
  
  return (
    <button 
      onClick={() => setClicked(true)}
      style={{ background: clicked ? 'blue' : 'gray' }}
    >
      Click me!
    </button>
  );
};
```

**Animated Button in Remotion:**
```tsx
import { useCurrentFrame, interpolate } from 'remotion';

const AnimatedButton = () => {
  const frame = useCurrentFrame();
  
  // Animate scale over 30 frames
  const scale = interpolate(frame, [0, 30], [1, 1.2], {
    extrapolateRight: 'clamp'
  });
  
  return (
    <div style={{
      transform: `scale(${scale})`,
      background: 'blue',
      padding: '10px 20px',
      display: 'inline-block'
    }}>
      Click me!
    </div>
  );
};
```

### Best Practices for Remotion Components

1. **Always use frame-based animations** - Never rely on time-based effects
2. **Keep components pure** - No side effects or external data fetching
3. **Use Remotion's hooks** - useCurrentFrame(), useVideoConfig(), etc.
4. **Leverage Sequences** - For timing different elements
5. **No interactive elements** - Remove all event handlers from UI components
6. **Deterministic rendering** - Ensure consistent output for video rendering
